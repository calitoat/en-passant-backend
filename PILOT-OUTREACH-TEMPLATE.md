# TrustBridge Pilot Outreach Templates

## Strategy: "Free Integration, Revenue Share"

Instead of selling badges directly to end-users, offer **free integration** to platforms with a revenue share model. This is the "Trojan Horse" approach.

**Value Prop:** "We eliminate fake leads/applications for free. You only pay when it works."

## Template 1: Niche Rental Platforms

**Target:** Regional rental sites, apartment listing platforms, property management software

**Subject Lines (A/B test):**
- Free "Verified Human" integration for [Platform Name]
- Eliminate fake rental applications - free pilot
- [Platform Name] + TrustBridge = No more bot applicants

**Body:**

```
Hi [Name],

I noticed [Platform Name] helps landlords find quality tenants in [market/region].

I built TrustBridge - a cryptographic identity verification system that solves the "fake applicant" problem. It uses OAuth (Gmail + LinkedIn) to prove someone is a real human, not a bot.

**What I'm offering:**
- Free integration of "Verified Human" badges on your platform
- Zero cost to you or your users during pilot
- I handle all the technical work (simple API or embed code)
- 70/30 revenue split IF you want to charge landlords for verified-only lead access

**Why this helps [Platform Name]:**
- Landlords waste less time on fake leads
- Your platform becomes the "trusted" option in [market]
- Competitive advantage over Zillow/Apartments.com
- Higher landlord retention (they get better leads)

The integration takes about 2 hours on your end. I've already built integrations for [X similar platforms].

## Objection Handling

**"We already have verification"**
> Most verification is easily bypassed (phone numbers, email, etc.). TrustBridge uses OAuth with established accounts (Gmail, LinkedIn) that take years to build. Much harder to fake.

**"Our users won't want to connect their accounts"**
> We've seen 60%+ opt-in rates when positioned as "get verified to stand out." Users WANT to prove they're real when it gives them an advantage.

**"How is this different from Persona/Jumio/ID verification?"**
> Those require government ID and are expensive ($2-5 per verification). TrustBridge is lightweight OAuth - 30 seconds, no ID upload, much cheaper.

**"What about privacy?"**
> We only access public profile info and email verification status. No email content, no connections list, no private data. Users can revoke access anytime.

**"We're too small/early for this"**
> Perfect timing! Bake trust into your platform from day one. It's a competitive moat that's hard to add later.
